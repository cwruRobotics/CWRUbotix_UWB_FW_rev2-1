# CWRUbotix UWB Firmware Rev 2.1
This repository is for the firmware for our second revision of CAN bus controlled UWB localization modules.

The hardware source files are currently on the CWRUbotix shared google drive and may be migrated to github in the future.

If you're interested in similar devices, check out the work done by [Repowered Robotics](http://wwww.repoweredrobotics.com) on UWB based localization systems.
